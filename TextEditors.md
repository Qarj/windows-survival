# Notepad ++

## Themes
Create a themes subfolder so you have: `C:\Program Files\Notepad++\themes`

Restart.

Select theme from Settings / Style Configurator

Material-Dark seems to have a lot of included languages - select the theme in Settings / Style Configurator
then check what languages are included.

## Syntax highlighting

http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php/User_Defined_Language_Files

Download syntax xml file to hard drive, then go into Language / Define you language ...

Then `Import ...` and select your xml file.

[Markdown Zenburn Classic](resources/NotepadPlusPlus-markdown.zenburn.classic.xml) works well with Material-Dark

Restart.

Then you might need to go into Settings / Style Configurator and check "Enable global background colour"

## Nice settings

* Settings / Preferences / MISC. / Clickable link settings
* Settings / Preferences / Language / Tab settings
